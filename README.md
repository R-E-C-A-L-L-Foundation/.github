# üß† R.E.C.A.L.L. Foundation

### *Research. Explicit Context. Archival. Linkage. Logic.*

The **R.E.C.A.L.L. Foundation** promotes open research and standardization in cognitive architectures and autonomous reasoning systems.
Its mission is to define and maintain foundational specifications that enable *continuity of cognition* ‚Äî bridging retrieval, memory, and reasoning in scalable, efficient systems.

## üìò The ACD Specification

The **Autonomous Continuous Development (ACD) Specification** defines a structured *hop-table for thought*.
Just as packet routing protocols move data efficiently through a network, ACD specifies how **contextual fragments** are routed through cognitive space.
Each ‚Äúhop‚Äù represents a deliberate transition between **retrieval**, **segmentation**, **memory**, **linkage**, and **logical integration**.

This transforms reasoning into an **addressable, recursive process** that enables systems to learn and evolve continuously:

* **Retrieval** locates relevant knowledge nodes.
* **Segmentation** isolates coherent cognitive packets.
* **Archival Memory** preserves relational state across sessions.
* **Linkage** constructs traceable chains of inference.
* **Logical Integration** reassembles those packets into higher-order understanding.

Unlike stateless predictive models, ACD-based systems maintain **continuity of cognition** ‚Äî a persistent, evolving map of reasoning that scales without brute-force compute.
