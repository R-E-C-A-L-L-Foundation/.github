## Welcome to the R.E.C.A.L.L Institute for Autonomous Continuous Development üëã

> **Routing cognition, not prediction.**

This is the **main organization repository** for the **R.E.C.A.L.L Institute**, home of the  
**Autonomous Continuous Development (ACD) Standard Specification** ‚Äî  
a framework defining deterministic, intent-anchored AI capable of continuous self-improvement.

### üìò Looking for the ACD Specification?
‚û°Ô∏è The full specification and supporting materials are maintained here:  
üëâ **[Autonomous Continuous Development (ACD) Standard Specification ‚Üí](https://github.com/RECALLInstituteACD/Autonomous-Continuous-Development-ACD-Standard-Specification)**

That repository contains:
- The complete ACD spec (`/spec/`)
- Templates, examples, and tests
- Contribution guidelines and governance details
- Ongoing drafts of the whitepaper and framework docs

---

### üß≠ About the Institute
The **R.E.C.A.L.L Institute** serves as the **steward of the ACD standard**, maintaining open research, governance,  
and long-term interoperability for deterministic AI systems.

We develop and maintain:
- The **ACD Standard Specification**
- **Reference implementations** and validation tools
- **Research frameworks** for autonomous, context-aware AI

For commercial licensing, SDKs, and integrations, visit our partner organization ‚Äî **RECALL Technologies**.
